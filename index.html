                        My name is Phillip Booker. This is the first draft of my portfolio. I hope to have some good content here soon!

                        I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering in 2014. I have basic programming knowledge, but I'm not very familiar with web development and have very little project experience. This bootcamp should be the perfect opportunity to fix that.

                        Outside of work and class I enjoy playing fighting games semi-competitively. I also have a passion for learning and helping others learn in the process. One of my dream projects is to be able to create a website/app that someone can use to learn something new!
